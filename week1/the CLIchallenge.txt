cd  <folder2> (to enter directory) and so on

or
mkdir -p <parentfolder>/<c>/<users>/<myusername>/<these>/<folders>/<are>/<just> (to create multiple nested directories)


How do I append a message to a file, without a newline character,
so the output would be: first message
                        second message
echo "first message" >> filename.txt  (will write the text on the first line)                       
echo "second message" >> filename.txt (will write the text on the second line)
